- [***2025.01***] [The road surface image dataset](https://github.com/sean-shiyuez/Extreme-Road-Image-Dataset) associated with the paper "Tire-Road Friction Coefficients Adaptive Estimation through Image and Vehicle Dynamics Integration" is now publicly available and researchers are welcome to access it.
- [***2024.12***] We are excited to announce the release of our ðŸ”¥
<a href="https://github.com/sean-shiyuez/High-Accuracy-Vehicle-Dynamic-Model" style="color: red;"><b>Python-based high-accuracy vehicle dynamic model</b></a> 
ðŸ”¥with a validated high-fidelity tire simulation, designed for both conventional and <b>drift driving</b> scenarios!

- [***2024.12***] We have open-sourced [a project](https://github.com/sean-shiyuez/Carsim_python_RL) using Simulink as a bridge for CarSim and Python co-simulation. We invite researchers to improve it and develop RL algorithms for real vehicles.
- [***2024.11***] [High-Speed Cornering Control and Real-Vehicle Deployment for Autonomous Electric Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11762) has been preprinted and we provides a very [interesting video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wp67FcpfL8).
