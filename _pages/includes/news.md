- [***2024.12***] We are excited to announce the release of our 
<a href="https://github.com/sean-shiyuez/High-Accuracy-Vehicle-Dynamic-Model" style="color: red;"><b>Python-based high-accuracy vehicle dynamic model</b></a> 
with a validated high-fidelity tire simulation, designed for both conventional and <b>drift driving</b> scenarios!

- [***2024.12***] We have open-sourced [a project](https://github.com/sean-shiyuez/Carsim_python_RL) using Simulink as a bridge for CarSim and Python co-simulation. We invite researchers to improve it and develop RL algorithms for real vehicles.
- [***2024.11***] [High-Speed Cornering Control and Real-Vehicle Deployment for Autonomous Electric Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11762) has been preprinted and we provides a very [interesting video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wp67FcpfL8).
- [***2024.11***] [Tire-Road friction coefficients adaptive estimation through image and vehicle dynamics integration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zTifikSaW06fIksXDjQr9h7dws8O3gsA/view?usp=share_link) has been accepted in MSSP Journal, and some of the image data involved in the study will be sent on request.
